# First Qt

*My first/learning Qt4 app in Ruby*

![App's window first screnshot](https://files.app.net/m0qnqn0BR.png)

- `first.ui.rb` was generated via `rbuic4 -x ui/first.ui -o first.ui.rb`
	- `rbuic4` is a part of [Ruby Qt bindings](https://rubygems.org/gems/qtbindings) (`gem install qtbindings`)
	- `ui/first.ui` was created in Qt4 Designer (`brew install qt && brew linkapps qt`)
